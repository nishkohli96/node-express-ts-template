# node-express-ts-template

Express JS Application with Typescript with the following features:

- Express **v5** app configured
- Handled loading of environment variables
- Preconfigured logger middleware - [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) for logging request details and errors 
- Docker image
- Run in production environment with `pm2`

**If you're setting up a frontend repository, you can use my [nextjs-template](https://github.com/nishkohli96/nextjs-template/pull/4) as a starting point.**

## Getting Started

```bash
sh setup.sh
```

The above command executes the `setup.sh` script to set up the project by:

- Ensuring [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) and [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) are installed globally.
- Installing all project dependencies.
- Building the app for the first time.

Run the app in `development` environment:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build the app and run production code:

```bash
pnpm prod
```

## Update Dependencies

[npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) is an excellent tool for detecting the latest versions of dependencies and updating them in your `package.json`. It simplifies the process of keeping your project up to date with the latest package versions.

### Installation

The `setup.sh` script globally installs **npm-check-updates**.

To update packages while also understanding the impact of the changes, run:

```bash
pnpm check-updates
```
This groups updates by type (**major**, **minor**, **patch**), making it easier to assess potential risks before upgrading.

Update all dependencies && check build status after updating all packages:

```bash
pnpm install-updates && pnpm build
```

## PM2

1.  You can use either env_file to read variables from, declare env variables in this file itself or do both. PM2 will load all variables from env_file and override any of them with keys from env.

2.  By default, `pm2 start` launches PM2 as a daemon process in the background. In a Docker environment, the container expects the main process to run in the foreground. If the main process exits Docker assumes the container has completed its task and shuts it down. Since PM2 detaches and runs in the background, Docker doesn't detect an active foreground process, leading to the container's immediate exit with code 0. ​

3.  The `pm2-runtime` is designed specifically for Docker environments, keeping the process in the foreground and ensuring the container remains active.

4.  If you enable the `watch` flag in `ecosystem.config.js`, make sure to also also add `ignore_watch: ['logs']` in the config file as this will prevent PM2 from watching the logs directory, thereby avoiding restarts triggered by log file updates.
